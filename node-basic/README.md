# Node Basic
## helloWorld.js
We can run the basic hello world code using node.
```
node helloWorld.js
```
Then you will see the result like below:
```
> node helloWorld.js
Hello World
Hello Node
```

## Module
We can also divide files into small multiple files. We can import variables or functions by using require(), and as you can see, you will be able to run the `index.js` and can see `func.js` and `var.js`'s exports are imported and successfully used within `index.js`.
```
> node index
even number
even number
odd number
```
